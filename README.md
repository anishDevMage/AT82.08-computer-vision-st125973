# AT82.08-computer-vision

This course offers a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to the field of computer vision, blending foundational principles with modern deep learning techniques. Students will begin by exploring the basics of image formation, manipulation, and traditional image processing methods like filtering, edge detection, and feature description. The curriculum then progresses to advanced topics, including data preparation for vision tasks, image classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and state-of-the-art methods for object detection, tracking, and image segmentation. The final weeks will cover the exciting domain of generative models, such as Autoencoders and GANs, and overview of 3D vision.

The course is structured around weekly lectures and labs, providing a strong practical component. Through a series of programming assignments, students will gain direct experience implementing and applying the algorithms discussed in class. Key assessments include a midterm exam, multiple assignments, and a final project, culminating in a presentation and final exam. The course is designed to equip students with a solid theoretical understanding and the practical skills necessary to solve real-world computer vision problems.
